# Tic-tac-toe

## Basics

Created first project for General Assembly-Boston Web Development Immersive
course, a playable single page application tic-tac-toe game that meets
pre-determined requirements to implement technologies we have learned so far.
See [requirements]
(https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project/blob/master/requirements.md) for
more details.

## Features / User Stories

*A user can sign-up, sign-in, change his/her password, and log out.
*A user can play a game of tic-tac-toe and be notified when x or o won
*A user can click `new game` to play a new game without refreshing the
percentage

##TODO

*As my game stands currently, it does not meet requirements. Currently I am
having difficulty with storing and displaying game stats for a user, and
creating game logic for tie conditions. Also, it would be nice to implement at
least some of the following:

*improve CSS for a better UI and UX (eg, hide sign-in/password buttons after
sign-in, make page less vertical, etc.)
*experiment with modals for sign-up, sign-in
*implement more semantic html tags (ie, avoid using divs whenever possible)
*separate css concerns by placing styles in 'themes', 'typography' files
*update game logic to reflect wins/losses/ties counter (currently static)
*update current game logic to reflect tie conditions (bug fix)
*make app responsive by adding breakpoints
*clean up my code by making it more readable and removing unnecessary code
blocks or commented-out lines
*improve the logic of my folder and file system with more files and enhanced
naming conventions

##TAKEAWAYS

Overall, I learned a lot from my first project at GA. I think my primary
takeaway is that I started seeing 'the big picture' a little more clearly,
by linking together all the technologies we've learned in class into one
project. I would like to become more comfortable writing javascript, and I
believe this will happen over time with more exposure and practice.
